# GitHubActions
GitHubActions is a simple and fun way to learn what Git hub actions are and implementing 
1. Bash shell commands
2. Run Shell script
3. Multi step Github actions -Adding value by logically organizing your workflows - If things fail its easier to troubleshoot the step.
4. Multi Job Github Actions - Steps run in sequence but Jobs run in parallel. - I learnt how important is identation.
